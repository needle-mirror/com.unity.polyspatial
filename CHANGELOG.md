### Added
- Initial PolySpatial package.
### Changed (from most recent pre-release)
- The codename `Quantum` has been changed to its release name `PolySpatial` with corresponding name changes throughout the package. 

- The volume camera, previously called `QuantumVolumeCamera` is now just called `VolumeCamera` and existing instances will need to be fixed. Other changed class names include:
    - `QuantumHoverEffect` is now `PolySpatialHoverEffect`

- The settings asset has been renamed, so you will need to recreate your `PolySpatial` project settings.
