    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added `PolySpatial Static Batch Element` component to support static batching relative to a root node or the scene root.\n- Added support for WebCamTexture to PSL.\n- Added support for Simple Noise, Parallax Mapping, Fog, and View Vector shader graph nodes.\n- Added `MaterialX` shader graph data extension and `Unlit Tone Mapping` option to enable tone mapping on unlit shader graph targets.\n- Added `Minify ShaderGraph Node Names` option (enabled by default), which improves load performance on visionOS for large shader graphs.\n- Added `Quit` as an option to the license check dialog to allow users to exit the app.\n- Added limited support for File source to the Custom Function shader graph node. See \"Source Types\" in the PolySpatial documentation for details.\n- Added a new auxiliary menu in Play To Device.\n- Added support for MaterialPropertyBlocks (currently requires dirtying the renderer via Unity.PolySpatial.PolySpatialObjectUtils.MarkDirty).\n- Added support for `Additive` and `Premultiply` blending modes for URP unlit/lit particle shaders with BakeToMesh.\n- Regular Unity Cameras (Camera component) are mirrored to cameras in the PolySpatial space. This only affects in-editor preview.\n- Added support for image masking for UGUI components.\n- Added ability to opt-out of PolySpatialRaycaster support if the user wishes to use a different raycaster.\n- Added support for non-`Exposed` shader graph properties (such as matrices, which cannot be exposed). \n\n### Changed\n- Changed how the Play To Device window validates new device entries.\n- Play to device Window is disabled when in incorrect build target or app mode configurations.\n- Play to device UI will appear in a new bounded volume when exiting play mode from an unbounded scene.\n- If an XROrigin exists \"Auto-Create Volume Camera\" will parent the VolumeCamera it creates to it.\n- Play to device runtime app further clarifies how to get started on the Editor side of Play to device.\n- Switched the `Reflection Probe` component validation to a message.\n- Removed the `Fix` button from the unsupported components validation. An unsupported component should not have any effect in the scene and can still be enabled.\n- Selectable UI elements (Buttons, Toggles, etc.) that are not Interactable will no longer show the visionOS hover effect when hovered.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n### Removed\n- Removed obsolete events (OnWindowOpened, OnWindowClosed, OnWindowFocused, OnWindowResized) from VolumeCamera. Please use OnWindowEvent to listen for window state changes.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed validation messages showing in the Inspector view when they are disabled.\n- Fixed UGUI elements being visible when Canvas was disabled.\n- Fixed sign of angles for Rotate About Axis shader graph node.\n- Fixed failure to transfer HDR color properties on shader graph materials on simulator/device.\n- Fixed console error message reporting `sysTypeDispatchData.klass == klass`. \n- Fixed Play to device UI sometimes having incorrect scale when exiting play mode.\n- Fixed implementation of shader graph Object node.\n- Fixed color space of TextMeshPro vertex colors.\n- Fixed colors applied to UGUI images.\n- Fixed crash that may occur when using a Box Collider on something that is also within a RectMask region.\n- Fixed color space of RGB24 images.\n- Fixed accidental application of tone mapping to built-in unlit materials.\n- Fixed visionOS Sorting Group \"Apply to Descendants\" option not applying to descendants created after sorting group initialized.\n- Fixed ArgumentNullException on MaterialPropertyBlock.SetTexture for UI elements.\n- Fixed tangent space output of View Direction shader graph node.\n- Fixed typo on PolySpatial settings on the Project Validation enum.\n- Fixed failure to hide UI elements contained in disjoint nested RectMask2D elements.\n- Fixed warnings for Custom Function shader graph nodes upstream of MaterialX \"Off\" keyword.\n- Fixed inverted textures when using `Replicate Properties` particle system mode.\n- Fixed animated material properties (currently requires dirtying the renderer via Unity.PolySpatial.PolySpatialObjectUtils.MarkDirty).\n- Fixed shader graph Voronoi node discontinuities and added support for Cells output.\n\n### Security"
